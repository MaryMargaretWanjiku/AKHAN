    <p>The Akhan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born </p>
    <p>These <em>"day names"</em> have further meanings concerning the soul and the character of the person </p>
    <p>Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
    <p>These names are also used among Ghanians living abroad and among Africans living in the diaspora who wish to identify with their ancenstral homeland</p>
    <p>Most Ghanians have atleast one name from this system,even if they also have an Arabic or Western name.</p>
