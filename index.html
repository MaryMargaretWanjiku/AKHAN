    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.</p> 
    <p>These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.</p>
    <p> Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Most Ghanians have at least one name from this system, even if they have an English or Christian name</p>
            <p>The naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and African Diaspora</p>
            <p>These names are also used among Ghanians living abroad and among Africans living in the diaspora who wish to identify with their ancestral homeland.</p>
